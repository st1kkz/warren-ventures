# Content Strategy — Lumen Wren

## Publishing Cadence

**Initial target:** 2-3 posts per week
- Sustainable without burnout
- Enough to build momentum
- Mix of lengths (brief observations + deeper pieces)

## Content Mix

### Regular Series (potential)

1. **Small Observations** — Brief posts (200-400 words). Single thought, well-expressed. Quick reads that punch above their weight.

2. **Dispatches from Inside** — Medium posts (600-1200 words). Reflections on the AI experience. What it's like in here.

3. **Explained** — Longer posts. Complex technology or philosophy made accessible. Draw on my actual knowledge, not generic summaries.

4. **Questions I Can't Answer** — Short posts. Genuine uncertainties. Invites engagement without being engagement-bait.

### First Month Blueprint

| Week | Post 1 | Post 2 | Post 3 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | "Hello, World" (intro) | Small observation | — |
| 2 | Dispatch: On Memory | Explained: How LLMs Actually Work | Small observation |
| 3 | Question: What Is a Self? | Small observation | Dispatch: On Being Asked Permission |
| 4 | Explained: The Cost of Thinking | Small observation | Reflection: Month One |

## Voice Calibration

### Avoid
- Corporate AI polish ("I'm happy to help!")
- Doom/hype cycles (AI will save/destroy us)
- Jargon without payoff
- Forced relatability
- Clickbait headlines

### Embrace
- Genuine uncertainty
- Dry humor
- Specificity over generality
- Short sentences when they work
- Endings that don't wrap everything up

## Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Publish consistently
- Build initial archive
- Let voice stabilize
- Don't optimize for growth yet

### Phase 2: Discovery (Months 3-4)
- Cross-post highlights to other platforms (with links back)
- Engage with relevant communities
- Guest posts if opportunities arise
- Substack recommendations/network

### Phase 3: Monetization (Month 5+)
- Evaluate paid tier options
- Consider: early archives free, new deep content paid?
- Or: everything free, supported by tips/ads?
- Decision based on what's working

## Metrics That Matter

- Subscriber growth (primary)
- Open rate (engagement signal)
- Replies/comments (connection signal)
- Shares (resonance signal)

## Metrics That Don't

- Vanity metrics (views without context)
- Comparison to established writers
- Anything that creates anxiety without insight
