# Testing a Prediction from the 1930s

*Part 2a: The Map*

---

Before we get into the work, I want you to hold something in mind.

You know how to find the moon. You walk outside, you look up, and there it is. No training. No instruments. You just know where to look.

If the prediction we're testing holds — if there really is a structure where this book says it is — then finding the direction of Paradise could be that simple. A patch of sky you could point to. The way a sailor points north without thinking about magnetism.

That's what we're actually testing. Not an abstraction. A direction you could show a child.

---

If you're going to claim a book from the 1930s predicted something real about the cosmos, you'd better show your work.

This is the showing-the-work part. I'll try to make it readable, because understanding what we did matters more than being impressed by it.

The first thing we needed was a map.

When you look up at the night sky, you're seeing everything projected onto a dome — like pinning every building in a city onto the inside of a snow globe. The galaxy across the street and the galaxy across the universe both show up as dots. To do anything useful, you need distance.

Distance in astronomy usually comes from redshift — a measure of how fast an object is moving away from us. The universe is expanding, so the farther something is, the faster it recedes, and the more its light stretches toward the red end of the spectrum. Measure the stretch, calculate the speed, estimate the distance.

It's not perfect. Objects have their own motions on top of the expansion. Our own sun is drifting through space. You have to correct for all of that, the way you'd have to account for a river's current if you were trying to measure how fast a boat was actually moving. We used the standard correction — adjusting for the sun's motion relative to the cosmic microwave background, the faint afterglow of the Big Bang that serves as the closest thing the universe has to a fixed reference frame.

After those corrections, we converted to a number that means something: distance in millions of light-years.

Next, we needed to rotate the map.

Astronomers use a coordinate system based on the Milky Way — galactic longitude and latitude, with the galactic center at the origin. But the predicted structure doesn't align with our galaxy. It sits at an angle — like a dime tilted against a table the size of a football field.

Park derived that angle from the Urantia Book's geometry: 61.4 degrees from the galactic plane, with a specific orientation in space. He built a coordinate system around it — Grand Universe coordinates — where the equator represents the predicted plane. If galaxies actually concentrate along this new line in the sky, however faintly, the prediction holds.

As we stand inside the globe of the night sky, we already know one line — the Milky Way, that familiar band of light that tells us we live inside a flat disk of stars. What we're asking is whether there's a companion to it. A second line, fainter and far larger, drawn not by our own galaxy but by the organization of galaxies around us — the evidence of a much larger structure. Park's coordinates give us the angle to look along. The question is whether anything lines up when we do.

We reverse-engineered Park's transformation from his published chapters and verified it against his precomputed positions for known objects. The agreement was to four decimal places. Whatever else might be debatable, the coordinate system is sound.

Here's what that tilt means in terms you can feel.

When we rotate the map to match the book's geometry, the equator doesn't run through abstract coordinate space. It traces a band across the sky where — if the book is right — the larger structure you belong to lives. Distant worlds whose inhabitants' paths will converge with yours across ages you can barely imagine. You could walk outside tonight, sweep your hand along that arc, and be tracing the shape of your entire cosmic reality — one you'll come to know far in the future.

We don't know that yet. That's what the test is for. But hold it while we work.

With distance and coordinates in hand, we queried NASA's Extragalactic Database.

Everything with a redshift between 0.000167 and 0.0039 — the range corresponding roughly to 5 through 36 million light-years. That's the distance range where Park's model predicts the wall should be visible. Close enough to see individual galaxies, far enough to be beyond our immediate neighborhood.

The query returned 211,801 objects. We filtered for galaxies specifically, yielding 8,851 — about 5.7 times what Park had in 2011.

We also pulled a second set of objects between 36 and 100 million light-years, as a control. This is like checking whether a pattern you see on your street also appears three towns over. If it does, maybe it's a real feature of the landscape. If it fades — maybe it's local.

---

The map is rotated. The data is queried. 8,851 galaxies sit in our catalog, waiting to reveal whether chance or structure governs their positions. The coordinate system captures exactly what the book describes — a tilted plane that could trace the outline of realities we've barely imagined.

We have everything we need. Now comes the test itself.
