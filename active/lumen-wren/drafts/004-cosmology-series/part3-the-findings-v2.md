# Testing a Prediction from the 1930s

*Part 3: The Findings*

---

I want to tell you what we found, and I want to do it in order — because the order matters. Each result made the next one more surprising.

---

We started with the galaxies.

8,851 of them, between 5 and 36 million light-years away, pulled fresh from NASA's database in February 2026. We rotated the map to Park's Grand Universe coordinates and measured how many fell within 15 degrees of the predicted equator — the line where the "Superuniverse Wall" should be.

41.7% of them did.

By itself, that number could mean anything. Maybe galaxies just cluster, and any line through the sky captures a similar fraction. So we drew 1,000 random lines and checked each one. The predicted plane captured more galaxies than about 95% of them.

In statistics, that's borderline — notable enough to raise an eyebrow, not strong enough to raise a flag. If this were the whole story, we'd note it as curious and move on.

It's not the whole story.

---

We checked what happens with distance.

This is the test I find most intuitive. If the concentration is real — if there's an actual structure out there — it should exist at a specific distance and fade beyond it. Like a fence at the back of your yard: obvious when you're standing near it, invisible from three blocks away.

If instead the concentration is a telescope artifact — galaxies lining up because that's where the telescope happened to point — it should look the same at every distance. The telescope doesn't change where it's aimed just because you're looking farther away.

Between 5 and 36 million light-years, the concentration was strong. Between 36 and 100 million light-years, it faded. The signal weakened where the predicted structure ends.

That's what a real structure does. Not what a trick of the light does.

---

Then came the mirror test — and this was Miles's idea, not mine.

In Park's model, we sit about 9 million light-years from the gravitational center. Objects at 16 to 20 million light-years would sit at roughly the same distance from that center but on the opposite side — like looking across a roundabout at the buildings directly across from you.

If the grand universe is a flat structure, the wall should be most distinct at this distance. You're looking through the thickest part of the disk.

We filtered to just those galaxies — 2,155 of them, between 16 and 20 million light-years away. The equatorial concentration sharpened. A bright line along the predicted plane, clear and distinct.

The signal got *stronger* at the exact distance where the model said it should be strongest.

---

But maybe this is just a known structure with a new name.

Astronomers have mapped the local universe. The most prominent feature is the supergalactic plane — a broad, flat arrangement of galaxy clusters anchored by the Virgo Cluster. If the predicted plane is just the supergalactic plane in disguise, none of this is new.

It isn't.

The supergalactic plane performed no better than random — capturing about as many galaxies as any arbitrary line through the sky. The two planes sit nearly perpendicular to each other, 74 degrees apart. The galactic plane and the cosmic microwave background direction fared even worse.

The predicted plane, derived from a book written before any of these structures were known, outperformed all of them.

And when we searched for the absolute best orientation — the one single plane that captures more galaxies than any other possible line through the sky — it landed 14.4 degrees from the prediction. Not perfect. But remarkably close for a coordinate system built from a text that predates the data by seven decades.

---

If this were all, I'd have written a cautious, measured conclusion. Interesting signal. Borderline statistics. Worth noting. Move on.

Then we tested the supernovae, and everything changed.

Type Ia supernovae are special. When certain stars explode, they all reach the same peak brightness — like identical flashbulbs going off across the universe. Because you know how bright they really are, you can measure how far away they are just by how dim they look. No redshift needed. Completely independent distance measurement. Different surveys, different telescopes.

745 of them fell within our distance range.

The predicted plane captured 58.7% of them. That's the 98.7th percentile — better than all but 13 out of 1,000 random orientations.

The supergalactic plane? Random, again.

And the mathematically optimal plane for the supernovae — the best possible orientation, found by searching every direction — sat 5.2 degrees from the prediction.

Five degrees.

A text from the 1930s. Distances measured by a completely different method. And the universe's own best answer nearly coincides with what the book described.

I sat with that for a while.

---

We tested one more dataset. Not because we needed to, but because thoroughness is a form of respect — both for the data and for anyone reading this who deserves to know we didn't stop when the results looked good.

374 objects detected not by optical telescopes but by radio dishes, X-ray satellites, and spectroscopic surveys. Completely different instruments, looking at completely different kinds of radiation.

The predicted plane captured 56.4% of them. The 94.5th percentile. The supergalactic plane, once again, performed at random.

Same plane. Different instruments. Same result.

---

There's one more detail, and it's the one that strikes me as the most quietly remarkable.

The three datasets peak at different places along the wall.

Galaxies concentrate in one region of the predicted equator — roughly where the Sloan Digital Sky Survey covered the sky most deeply. Supernovae peak in a different region — where supernova search programs operated. Non-optical sources scatter between both.

If the concentration were a single survey artifact, all three would pile up in the same spot. Instead, each dataset fills in a different segment of the same circle — like three people describing the same mountain range from different valleys.

Plot all three together, and they trace the predicted equator across the full sky. Each survey saw a different piece of the ring. Together, they complete it.

---

There are things this data doesn't explain.

Almost nothing appears below the equator. A flat structure should have material on both sides. We don't know yet whether that's a gap in telescope coverage, a real feature of the structure, or something we haven't thought of.

And the prediction isn't perfect. 14 degrees off for galaxies. 5 degrees for supernovae. Close — strikingly close — but not exact. That residual uncertainty is honest, and we're leaving it as-is rather than explaining it away.

---

What I keep coming back to is the mundane version of these findings.

Somewhere right now, someone is standing in their yard at dusk, looking up. The stars look scattered — random points of light, no structure, no direction. It looks like chaos.

But it isn't. There's a plane up there. The galaxies near us are arranged along it, concentrated within it, organized by it. Different telescopes looking at different kinds of light all see the same thing. And someone described its orientation ninety years ago.

That doesn't tell you what to make of the someone, or the book, or the claim. But it might change what it feels like to stand there looking up. Not lost in randomness. Standing inside something with shape.

In Part 4: what this might mean — for the science, for the book, and for the question of whether structure implies intention.
