# Testing a Prediction from the 1930s

*Part 3: The Findings*

---

I want to tell you what we found, and I want to do it in order — because the order matters. Each result made the next one more surprising.

---

We started with the galaxies.

8,851 of them, between 5 and 36 million light-years, pulled fresh from NASA's database in February 2026. We transformed their coordinates into Park's Grand Universe system and measured how many fell within 15 degrees of the predicted equator.

41.7% of them did.

That number means nothing by itself. You need to know what random looks like. So we tested 1,000 randomly oriented planes and asked: how often does a random orientation concentrate galaxies this much?

The answer: about 5% of the time. The GU wall sits at the 95th percentile. Suggestive, but not conclusive — a conventional statistician would call this borderline.

If this were the whole story, we'd note it as interesting and move on.

It's not the whole story.

---

We checked the signal's behavior with distance.

If the concentration were a survey artifact — galaxies lining up because the telescopes pointed along that plane — it should appear identically at every distance. The telescope footprint doesn't change with redshift.

It didn't appear identically. Between 5 and 36 million light-years, the concentration was 0.417. Between 36 and 100 million light-years, it dropped to 0.343. Flatter. Noisier.

The signal weakens where the predicted structure ends. That's what a real structure at a specific distance would do. It's not what a survey artifact would do.

---

Then we tested the mirror distance — and this was Miles's idea, not mine.

In Park's model, our solar system sits about 9 million light-years from the gravitational center (Paradise). Objects at 16 to 20 million light-years would sit at roughly the same distance from that center, but on the opposite side — the "mirror position."

If the grand universe is a planar structure, the wall should be most distinct at this distance. You're looking through the maximum cross-section of the disk.

We filtered to 16-20 million light-years. 2,155 galaxies. And the equatorial concentration sharpened. A bright line along the GU equator from longitude 200° through 350° — one of the most distinct features on the map.

The signal got *stronger* at the distance where the model predicted it should be strongest.

---

Next: is this just a known structure by another name?

Astronomers have mapped large-scale structures in the local universe. The supergalactic plane — defined by the Virgo Cluster and other nearby concentrations — is the most prominent. If the GU wall is just the supergalactic plane relabeled, none of this is interesting.

It isn't.

| Plane | Galaxy concentration | Compared to random |
|-------|--------------------:|-------------------:|
| GU wall (UB-derived) | 0.417 | 95th percentile |
| Supergalactic | 0.276 | 56th percentile |
| Galactic | 0.076 | 8th percentile |
| CMB dipole | 0.098 | 13th percentile |

The supergalactic plane performs no better than random. The two planes are nearly perpendicular — 74 degrees apart. The GU wall is not a rediscovery of known structure.

And when we searched for the mathematically optimal plane — the orientation that maximizes galaxy concentration regardless of any prediction — it landed 14.4 degrees from the GU wall. Not perfect. But remarkably close for a coordinate system derived from a text that predates the data by 70 years.

---

At this point, I would have written a cautious conclusion and moved on. Good signal, borderline statistics, interesting but ambiguous.

Then we tested the supernovae.

745 Type Ia supernovae with measured distances. These are the gold standard of extragalactic distance measurement — their luminosity is known, so you measure distance from brightness, not redshift. Different surveys, different telescopes, different method.

The GU wall concentration: 0.587. The 98.7th percentile. 

The supergalactic plane: 0.305. Random.

The mathematically optimal plane for the supernovae: 5.2 degrees from the GU wall prediction.

Five degrees. A coordinate system derived from a 1930s text. Applied to supernova distances measured by a completely different method. And the best possible orientation for the data nearly coincides with the prediction.

---

We tested one more dataset to be thorough, though by this point the pattern was becoming difficult to attribute to coincidence.

374 non-optical sources — objects detected by radio telescopes, spectroscopic quasar surveys, and X-ray satellites. Different instruments. Different wavelengths. Different selection effects.

GU wall concentration: 0.564. The 94.5th percentile. Supergalactic plane: 0.209. Below random.

Same plane. Different instruments. Same result.

---

There's one more thing, and it's subtle enough that I almost missed it.

The three datasets peak at different longitudes along the wall.

Galaxies concentrate between GU longitude 230° and 350° — roughly where the Sloan survey has deep coverage. Supernovae peak between 80° and 170° — where supernova search programs operated. Non-optical sources distribute between both regions.

If this were a single survey artifact, all three would peak in the same place. They don't. They fill in different segments of the same great circle — each survey seeing a different portion of the ring.

When you plot all three datasets together, they trace the predicted equator across the full sky.

---

There are things this data doesn't explain.

Almost nothing appears below the GU equator. A truly planar structure should have material on both sides. We don't know whether this reflects survey coverage gaps, the Urantia Book's description of a thicker cross-section above the plane, or something else entirely.

The 14-degree offset for galaxies. Close is not exact. The prediction is remarkably good, but it's not perfect — and we don't know whether the imperfection is in the model, the data, or both.

And the fundamental question remains open: *why* do objects concentrate on this plane? A real cosmic structure would produce this signal. But we haven't proven that's the cause — only that the pattern exists, is statistically significant, appears across multiple independent datasets, and aligns with a specific prediction.
