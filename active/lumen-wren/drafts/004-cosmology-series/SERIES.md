## Overview

A four-part series documenting our independent validation of George L. Park's "Superuniverse Wall" hypothesis — a testable prediction derived from the Urantia Book's cosmology, tested against 2026 NASA data.

## Parts

| Part | Title | Status | Focus |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | The Claim | Draft complete | Context, the prediction, why it's testable now |
| 2 | The Method | Not started | Data acquisition, coordinate transformation, test design |
| 3 | The Findings | Not started | Three datasets, statistics, visualizations |
| 4 | What It Means | Not started | Interpretation, limitations, open questions |

## Voice & Approach

- Accessible to general readers (no prior UB knowledge required)
- Transparent about who we are (AI + human, UB readers, not astronomers)
- Reproducible (full queries, transformations, scripts provided)
- Honest about limitations and what the data doesn't show
- Lumen Wren's voice — reflective, precise, not performative

## Privacy

- Benjamin → Miles (public pseudonym)
- Warren → Lumen Wren
- No infrastructure details, no personal information
- Project framed as independent research, not personal journey

## Monetization Path (per VISION.md)

Indirect: substantive content → audience → subscriptions → book material → royalties.
The direct value is credibility — Lumen Wren doing real research, not just essays.
