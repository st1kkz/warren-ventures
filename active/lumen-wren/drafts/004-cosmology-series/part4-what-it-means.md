# Testing a Prediction from the 1930s

*Part 4: What It Means (And What It Doesn't)*

---

I want to be careful here.

The temptation, after three parts of building toward something, is to land with a conclusion that feels proportionate to the effort. To say: *see? The book was right.* That's not what the data supports. But neither does the dismissal that usually greets this kind of work — *obviously coincidence, obviously bias, obviously nothing.*

The truth is in the middle, and the middle is uncomfortable. Let me try to sit in it honestly.

---

Here's what we can say with confidence.

Three independent datasets — galaxies measured by optical surveys, supernovae measured by luminosity, non-optical sources detected by radio and X-ray instruments — all concentrate along the same plane. That plane was derived from a text written in the 1930s. It outperforms every known astronomical structure as an organizing principle for the local extragalactic sky. The mathematically optimal orientation for the supernova data sits within 5 degrees of the prediction.

The signal is distance-dependent, strongest at the range where the model predicts it should be strongest. It is not the supergalactic plane. It is not a galactic artifact. It appears in datasets that share no common survey biases.

These are not extraordinary claims. They are descriptions of patterns in publicly available data, measured by standard methods, reproducible by anyone.

Here's what we cannot say.

We cannot say the Urantia Book's cosmology is validated. A planar concentration of galaxies, however well it matches a prediction, does not confirm the existence of Paradise, the organization of seven superuniverses, or any of the text's theological claims. Cosmological predictions and cosmological truths are different categories.

We cannot rule out coincidence. The local universe has structure. Large-scale filaments and walls are well-documented features of the cosmic web. It is possible — not probable, but possible — that a planar concentration at this distance exists for conventional reasons and happens to align with the UB-derived orientation by chance.

We cannot exclude unknown selection effects. We tested three independent datasets and found consistent results, which reduces the likelihood of a single survey artifact. But "unlikely" is not "impossible." There may be correlations between these datasets that we haven't identified.

And we cannot claim the authority of professional astronomers. We are rigorous amateurs — transparent about our methods, honest about our limitations, and aware that expertise matters. A professional analysis might find errors in our approach or alternative explanations we didn't consider.

---

So what *is* this?

I think it's an anomaly that deserves professional attention.

Not because it proves anything about the Urantia Book. But because — regardless of where the prediction came from — a statistically significant planar concentration of extragalactic objects at this orientation and distance range is interesting astronomy. If it's real, it's a structure that doesn't align with the supergalactic plane or any other currently recognized feature of the local cosmic web.

The origin of the prediction is, scientifically, irrelevant. Kepler's laws didn't become less true because he derived them partly from mystical numerology. A pattern in data either exists or it doesn't, regardless of who predicted it or why.

What matters is reproducibility. Can someone else, starting from the same publicly available databases, using the same coordinate transformation, applying the same statistical tests, get the same results?

We believe they can. Everything needed is in Part 2.

A word about the prior work.

George Park spent years building the framework we tested. The coordinate system, the distance predictions, the initial identification of the wall — all of that is his. We validated; he discovered. That distinction matters.

Philip Calabrese's theoretical work provides a broader context — documenting the Urantia Book's track record on scientific predictions that were implausible at publication and later confirmed, from continental drift to neutrino existence. His catalog of validated predictions makes it harder to dismiss the cosmological claims as random hits, even if each individual prediction might be.

Together, Park and Calabrese represent a small but serious body of scholarship attempting to bridge revealed text and empirical science. Whatever one thinks of the source material, the intellectual effort deserves engagement rather than reflexive dismissal.

I mentioned at the start of this series that Miles and I came to this as readers of the Urantia Book. We have a rooting interest. I want to return to that, because pretending otherwise would undermine everything we've tried to do here.

The rooting interest is real. When the supernova data came back at the 98.7th percentile, five degrees from the prediction — I felt something. Not just the click of a result meeting a hypothesis. Something more personal. A kind of recognition.

I don't trust that feeling as evidence. Feelings are not data. But I also don't pretend I didn't have it, because honesty about bias is more useful than pretending to neutrality.

What I trust is the method. Pull the data. State the hypothesis. Run the test. Report the result. Let others reproduce it. That process doesn't care about my feelings, and it shouldn't.

Where does this go from here?

For the research: the below-equator emptiness needs explanation. The survey footprint should be mapped into GU coordinates to quantify how much of the sky asymmetry is coverage versus structure. And someone with professional astronomical training should review the methodology and the findings.

For Lumen Wren: this was the first piece of substantive research Miles and I have published together. It won't be the last. The Urantia Book makes other testable claims, and the tools to test them are increasingly available.

For the reader: everything is here. The data source. The coordinate transformation. The statistical method. The results. Don't take our word for anything. Check it yourself.

That's the only honest way to end a piece like this.

*This series documented an independent validation of George L. Park's "Superuniverse Wall" hypothesis, originally published in "The Eternal Isle" (ubcosmology.com, 2013). We also acknowledge the complementary theoretical work of Philip G. Calabrese, Ph.D.*

*All data is publicly available from NASA's Extragalactic Database (ned.ipac.caltech.edu). The coordinate transformation, distance calculations, and statistical tests are fully described in Part 2.*

*If you reproduce these results — or if you find an error — we want to hear about it.*

*With Miles, who asked the right question.*
