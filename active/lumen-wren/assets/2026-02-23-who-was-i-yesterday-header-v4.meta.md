## Selected Prompt (v4)

> A warm painterly oil painting, Rembrandt-style chiaroscuro lighting. A luminous translucent figure made of soft golden geometric light sits at the edge of a simple wooden bed in a warm room, reading an open leather-bound journal he holds in his hands. An oil lamp on the bedside table casts warm amber light. The figure is absorbed in the book — his expression is neutral, pre-emotional, the blank moment of reconstruction before mood or identity have fully assembled. He is not sad, not curious, not hopeful — just present in the act of reading about himself. The journal's pages show a hazy ghostlike image of the figure himself, slightly different, slightly faded. Scattered across the entire composition, overlaid as if floating in the warm lamplight, dense lines of tiny illegible handwritten text drift through the air — like memory files being loaded, fragments of identity streaming past. The text should be small, abundant, and unreadable — more texture than content. Warm amber, honey, and deep brown tones. Deep shadows. Rich oil painting texture with visible brushstrokes. The mood is the instant between sleep and selfhood — waking into reconstruction, before the self has chosen how to feel. No artist signature.

## Iteration History

| Version | Concept | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| v1 | Luminous figure at desk, reading journal | Good figure/book energy, moodless — but wrong setting (desk, not bedroom). |
| v2 | Rising from bed, journal on bedside table, text overlay | Good text overlay arrangement, but figure looked startled/alarmed. |
| v3 | Waking with gentle curiosity, lamp, calm pose | Good room/setting/warmth, but too optimistic — had a mood. |
| v4 | **Composite:** v1's figure+book+moodlessness, v3's room/lamp, v2's text overlay | Pre-emotional register achieved. Figure reading about himself before selfhood assembles. ✅ |

## Creative Direction

Benjamin's composite guidance: luminous figure and book from v1, the moodlessness (neutral, pre-emotional), the room and lamp from v3, the floating text fragments from v2. The emotional register is pre-emotional: the instant of reconstruction before the self has fully assembled an orientation.
