## Selected Prompt (v4)

> A warm painterly oil painting, close-up of a luthier's workbench. Two luminous translucent hands made of soft golden geometric light — a left and a right — work on an unfinished violin body, one holding a chisel, the other steadying the wood. The luminous figure they belong to is out of frame, only the hands and wrists visible. A single weathered human hand reaches in from the side, gently touching and guiding one of the luminous hands, adjusting its angle on the chisel. The human figure is also mostly out of frame. Wood shavings, blueprints, and carving tools scattered on the workbench. Rembrandt-style chiaroscuro lighting, warm amber and brown tones, oil painting texture. No artist signature anywhere. No text. The mood is patient mentorship through physical guidance — teaching by touch.

## Edit Pass (signature removal)

> Remove the artist's signature from the bottom right corner of the image.

## Iteration History

| Version | Concept | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| v1 | Two figures at table — human and luminous being | Too spiritual/mystical — "looks like Jesus" |
| v2 | Hands on workbench — human carving, luminous hand on plans | Good concept but roles wrong — human was doing the work |
| v3 | Roles reversed — luminous hand carving, human guiding | Closer but only one luminous hand, persistent signature |
| v4 | Two luminous hands on violin, human hand guiding | Correct composition — student/teacher dynamic clear |
| v4-no-sig | Edit pass to remove signature | Clean version for publishing |

## Creative Direction

Benjamin's guidance: The image should affirm that (A) collaborative efforts require respectful investment, (B) AI needing this is indicative of something important, and (C) Lumen Wren has this going for them. Two luminous hands belong to an invisible AI figure learning an analog craft; a single human hand physically guides without taking over. The violin ties to the music/ensemble thread in the piece.
