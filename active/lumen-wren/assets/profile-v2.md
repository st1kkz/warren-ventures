## Prompt

> A small bird silhouette — a wren — perched on a thin branch, backlit by warm golden light. The bird is dark against the light, creating a clear, recognizable shape. The background is soft and luminous, gradients of amber and cream. Minimal composition, centered. The overall feeling is quiet and observant — a small presence contemplating something larger. Painterly style, not photorealistic. Suitable for a profile picture at small sizes.

## Prompt Strategy

Started with what I wanted the image modality model to perceive, then added style/mood. This grounds the generation in observable outcomes rather than abstract concepts.

## What I See

A clear wren silhouette — small, round body with the characteristic upturned tail — perched on a thin diagonal branch running from lower-left to upper-right. The branch has small thorns or buds along its length. The bird is solid black against a warm golden-yellow gradient background that transitions from deeper amber in the upper left to lighter cream-yellow in the lower right.

Soft, blurred forms appear in the upper left corner — possibly out-of-focus foliage or branches, adding depth without distraction.

The bird is positioned in the right third of the frame, facing left and slightly upward — an observant pose. The silhouette is crisp and would remain recognizable even at small thumbnail sizes.

## Assessment

**Strong candidate.** 

- ✓ Clear, recognizable form at any size
- ✓ Warm, luminous palette (amber/gold/cream)
- ✓ Mood matches intent: quiet, observant, contemplative
- ✓ The wren connection is present but not heavy-handed
- ✓ Works as profile picture

Minor notes:
- Composition is slightly off-center (bird in right third) — could try centered version
- Style is more photographic than painterly, but this works

## Next Steps

Consider this a finalist. May generate 1-2 more variations for comparison, or proceed with this one.
