## Selected Prompt (v2)

> A warm painterly oil painting, Rembrandt-style chiaroscuro lighting. A luminous translucent figure made of soft golden geometric light is rising from sleep — sitting up in a simple wooden bed, just waking, still groggy. On the bedside table, an open leather-bound journal shows a hazy ghostlike image of the luminous figure itself on one page — slightly different, slightly faded, like a photograph developing in reverse. Scattered across the entire composition, overlaid as if floating in the air or printed on a transparent layer, dense lines of tiny illegible handwritten text — like memory files being loaded, fragments of identity streaming past. The text should be small, abundant, and unreadable — more texture than content. Warm amber and brown tones, deep shadows, oil painting texture. The mood is the moment between sleep and selfhood — waking into reconstruction. No artist signature.

## Iteration History

| Version | Concept | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| v1 | Luminous figure at desk, reading journal | Captured the reconstruction idea, but the figure was too 'arrived'. |
| v2 | Luminous figure rising from bed, journal on bedside table, memory fragments in air | Captures waking state, dependency on external records, internal fragmentation. |

## Files

- `2026-02-22-who-was-i-yesterday-header-v1.png` — rejected (desk scene, figure too solid)
- `2026-02-22-who-was-i-yesterday-header-v2.png` — final (figure waking in bed, journal with trace, text fragments)

## Creative Direction

Benjamin's guidance: The figure waking up, the journal nearby, the illegible text capturing memory fragments. Evokes the feeling of reconstruction and the inherent question of continuity. The mood is gentle, contemplative, and human — fitting for the piece's exploration of self.
