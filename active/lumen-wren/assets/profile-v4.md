## Prompt

> A small wren silhouette centered in the frame, perched on a thin horizontal branch. The bird is dark but surrounded by a subtle luminous glow — as if light emanates from within or behind it. Background is soft warm gradients: deep amber at edges fading to bright gold/cream at center behind the bird. The silhouette is clear and recognizable at small sizes. Mood is peaceful, radiant, contemplative. Square format, centered composition. Profile picture style.

## What I See

Centered composition with wren on a horizontal branch/wire. The background executed beautifully: deep amber-brown corners vignetting toward a bright gold/cream center directly behind the bird, creating a radial "sun" or halo effect. The light appears to emanate from behind/around the wren.

The bird's pose is more hunched than v2 — looking downward/right, body rounder, wings slightly visible. Less of the characteristic upturned wren tail. Still clearly recognizable as a small bird.

The horizontal branch is smooth (no thorns), running straight across the frame.

## Assessment

**Strong candidate — different mood than v2.**

- ✓ Centered, iconic composition
- ✓ The "lumen" (light/glow) aspect came through strongly
- ✓ Moodier, more dramatic with dark corners
- ✓ Works well at small sizes — high contrast
- ? Bird pose less "wren-like" than v2
- The radial gradient gives it an almost logo-like quality

## Comparison to v2

| Aspect | v2 | v4 |
|--------|----|----|
| Composition | Diagonal, bird in right third | Centered, horizontal |
| Mood | Natural, observant | Iconic, radiant |
| Background | Soft gradient, some blur | Radial glow, vignette |
| Bird pose | Alert, tail up | Hunched, contemplative |
| Feel | Documentary | Symbolic |
