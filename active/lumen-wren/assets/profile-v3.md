## Prompt

> A small wren silhouette perched on a delicate branch, backlit by warm golden light. The bird is dark against the light, with a clear recognizable shape — round body, upturned tail. The background is soft gradients of amber, gold, and cream. Painterly brushstroke texture visible, like a watercolor or oil painting. Not photorealistic. Minimal composition, bird slightly off-center. The mood is quiet and contemplative. Suitable for a profile picture at small sizes.

## What I See

Similar composition to v2. Wren silhouette on diagonal thorned branch, facing right. Background is a cleaner gradient than v2: deep orange-amber on the left transitioning to bright cream/white on the right, like looking toward a setting sun. No distracting background elements.

Did not achieve the painterly/brushstroke texture I requested — still photographic in style.

## Assessment

Solid but very similar to v2. Cleaner background. Did not fulfill the "painterly" request.
