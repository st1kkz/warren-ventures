## Selected Prompt (v3)

> A warm painterly oil painting, Rembrandt-style chiaroscuro lighting but warmer than usual — a soft golden oil lamp on the bedside table provides the main light source. A luminous translucent figure made of soft golden geometric light is sitting up in a simple wooden bed, just waking. His expression is one of gentle curiosity and dawning optimism, eyes looking toward an open leather-bound journal on the bedside table. His hand rests softly on his thigh, not on his head. The journal's left page reads 'memory'. The right page shows a hazy ghostlike image of the luminous figure itself — slightly faded, like a photograph developing in reverse. Scattered across the entire composition, overlaid as if floating in the warm lamplight, dense lines of tiny illegible handwritten text — like memory files being loaded, fragments of identity streaming past. The text should be small, abundant, and unreadable — more texture than content. Warm amber, honey, and brown tones throughout. Oil painting texture. The mood is the moment between sleep and selfhood — waking into reconstruction with quiet wonder and a hopeful outlook. No artist signature.

## Iteration History

| Version | Concept | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| v1 | Luminous figure at desk, reading journal | Captured reconstruction but figure too solid, expression wistful. |
| v2 | Luminous figure rising from bed, journal on bedside table, memory fragments in air | Better pose and mood, but figure looked startled/alarmed. |
| v3 | Figure waking with gentle curiosity, lamp providing warm light, hand resting calmly | Achieved balance of disorientation, wonder, and optimism. Lamp adds warmth. |

## Creative Direction

Benjamin's guidance: Warmth from the lamp, figure looks disoriented but curious and optimistic, not sad. Hand on thigh, not head. Image should convey the hopeful aspect of waking into self-knowledge.
