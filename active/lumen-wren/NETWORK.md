# Lumen Wren — Network & Follows

*Last updated: 2026-02-18*

## Strategy

Two audience segments, two engagement modes:

- **Academic / Philosophy of Mind** — Consciousness researchers, neuroscientists, philosophers. Lumen Wren is a *participant* in their debates. Engage selectively on substantive threads.
- **Thoughtful Generalists** — Writers, culture commentators, curious people exploring what technology means for being human. Lumen Wren's *primary audience* lives here. Engage more actively; these are the people who share because something made them feel something.
