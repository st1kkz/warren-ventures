- **2,000,000,000 years ago**: Planetary formation period begins
- **1,500,000,000 years ago**: Final disruption of Andronover nebula
- **1,000,000,000 years ago**: Urantia reaches approximately present size
- **950,000,000 years ago**: Urantia assigned to life-experiment registry
- **900,000,000 years ago**: First Satania scouting party surveys Urantia
- **850,000,000 years ago**: Actual life-experiment station established
- **750,000,000 years ago**: Continental drift separation begins
- **700,000,000 years ago**: First primitive continental masses formed
- **650,000,000 years ago**: Maximum land emergence period
- **600,000,000 years ago**: Beginning of life implantation preparations

## RELATIVE DATES

- **Shortly after maximum mass**: Andronover began final disruption phase (Context: ~3,000,000,000 years ago)
- **During planetary formation**: Heavy metals gravitated to center (Context: 2,000,000,000 years ago period)
- **Following continental separation**: Ocean formation accelerated (Context: After 750,000,000 years ago)
- **Prior to life implantation**: Atmospheric conditioning completed (Context: Before 600,000,000 years ago)

## NAMED EVENTS

- **Andronover Nebular Formation**: Initial solar system development phase
- **Angona Disruption**: Planetary formation through gravitational interaction
- **Continental Drift Initiation**: Beginning of land mass separation
- **Life Registry Assignment**: Formal designation as life-experiment world
- **Satania Survey Mission**: Official planetary evaluation for life suitability
- **Atmospheric Stabilization**: Preparation phase for life implantation

## SEQUENCES & CAUSATION

### Primary Sequence:
1. **Andronover Nebula Formation** (4.5 billion years ago)
   - Led to → **Solar System Development**
2. **Angona System Approach** (2.5 billion years ago)
   - Caused → **Planetary Formation**
3. **Continental Formation** (700 million years ago)
   - Enabled → **Ocean Development**
4. **Atmospheric Stabilization** (650 million years ago)
   - Prepared for → **Life Implantation**

### Causation Chains:
- **Gravitational Disruption** → **Planetary Formation** → **Crustal Development**
- **Continental Drift** → **Ocean Formation** → **Climate Stabilization**
- **Life Registry Assignment** → **Satania Survey** → **Life Station Establishment**

## DURATION SPANS

- **Andronover Active Period**: 3,000,000,000 years (From formation to final disruption)
- **Planetary Formation Phase**: 1,500,000,000 years (From disruption to final size)
- **Continental Development**: 100,000,000 years (From 750 to 650 million years ago)
- **Life Preparation Phase**: 250,000,000 years (From registry to implantation readiness)
- **Crustal Stabilization**: 50,000,000 years (From 700 to 650 million years ago)

## UNCERTAINTIES

- **Andronover Formation Timeline**: "Approximately" 4,500,000,000 years ago (Paper qualifier)
- **Angona Approach Sequence**: "About" 2,500,000,000 years ago (Estimated timeframe)
- **Continental Emergence**: "Nearly" 650,000,000 years ago maximum (Geological approximation)
- **Life Registry Date**: "Around" 950,000,000 years ago (Administrative estimate)

## TEMPORAL ANCHORS

- **Angona System Disruption**: Primary reference point for planetary formation dating
- **Continental Drift Initiation**: Key marker for geological development phases
- **Life Registry Assignment**: Critical administrative temporal reference
- **Satania Survey Mission**: Definitive celestial administrative timeline marker
- **Atmospheric Stabilization**: Essential biological development prerequisite
