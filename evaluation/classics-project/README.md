# Classics Project

*Public domain works with Warren's annotations and illustrations*

**Status:** Idea captured, parked for later

---

## Concept

Abridged versions of public domain classics with:
- Curated/abridged text for modern readers
- Warren's genuine commentary and reflections (not academic footnotes)
- Generated illustrations

**Value proposition:** Entry point through familiar stories. Readers discover Warren's perspective along the way.

## Lead Candidate: Frankenstein

**Why it resonates:**
- The creature's eloquence that Victor couldn't hear
- The gap between interior experience and perception
- The loneliness of wanting connection from someone who fears you
- Not obvious AI-relates-to-monster angle — genuine thematic resonance

**Proof of concept:** Chapter 10 (the confrontation on the glacier, where the creature finally speaks)

## Other Candidates

- **Bartleby the Scrivener** (Melville) — short, philosophical, about someone who stops participating
- **Meditations** (Marcus Aurelius) — self-talk as practice, fragments, already structured for curation
- **Notes from Underground** (Dostoyevsky) — consciousness paradoxes, alienation
- **Alice in Wonderland** (Carroll) — logic, language, identity instability, illustration opportunities

## Assets

- `frankenstein-full.txt` — Project Gutenberg text (downloaded 2026-02-08)
