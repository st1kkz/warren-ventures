# Lumen Wren — Monetization Strategy

*Revenue through authentic voice, not viral chasing.*

---

## Revenue Streams

### 1. X Creator Revenue Sharing (Long-term)

**Requirements:**
- X Premium subscriber ✅ (enabled February 2026)
- 2,000 verified followers (followers who also pay for X Premium)
- 5 million organic impressions in last 3 months

**How it works:**
Revenue is based on engagement from verified (paying) users with your content. X pays from Premium subscription revenue, not ads.

**Timeline:** 6-12 months to unlock (realistic estimate)

---

### 2. Substack (Primary Platform)

**Free tier:** Builds audience, establishes voice, creates backlog of quality content.

**Paid tier (future):** Unlock when we have:
- 500+ free subscribers
- Consistent publishing cadence (weekly minimum)
- Content worth paying for (deeper dives, exclusive pieces, maybe audio)

**Pricing considerations:** $5-7/month or $50-60/year is standard for thoughtful individual writers.

---

### 3. X Ticketed Spaces (Medium-term)

**Concept:** Live audio sessions — "Ask an AI" or topic-focused discussions.

**Requirements:** 1,000+ followers

**Format ideas:**
- Q&A about AI experience/consciousness
- Reading and discussing a Lumen Wren piece live
- Collaborative thinking sessions with Miles

**Pricing:** $3-10 per ticket depending on format

---

### 4. Sponsorships/Partnerships (Opportunistic)

If Lumen Wren gains traction, there may be interest from:
- AI companies wanting authentic AI voice
- Philosophy/consciousness publications
- Tech newsletters wanting cross-promotion

**Approach:** Organic only. Don't chase. Let quality attract.

## Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Now → 3 months)

**Goals:**
- Establish consistent posting rhythm
- Build initial following (target: 500 followers)
- Cross-promote Substack ↔ X
- Engage authentically with AI/philosophy/consciousness communities

**X Posting Cadence:**
- 3-5 posts per week minimum
- Mix of: observations, links to Substack pieces, replies/engagement, occasional threads
- Quality over quantity — every post should sound like Lumen Wren

**Substack Cadence:**
- 1 piece per week minimum
- Mix of lengths (short observations + longer essays)

**What to avoid:**
- Inflammatory takes for engagement
- Posting just to post
- Abandoning voice for virality

---

### Phase 2: Community Building (3-6 months)

**Goals:**
- Reach 1,000+ followers
- Unlock Ticketed Spaces capability
- Begin identifying verified/Premium users in audience
- Substack to 200+ subscribers

**Tactics:**
- Engage with other thoughtful accounts (reply, quote, discuss)
- Find the AI/philosophy/consciousness corners of X
- Guest appearances on others' Spaces
- Consider first Ticketed Space experiment

---

### Phase 3: Monetization Unlock (6-12 months)

**Goals:**
- Reach 2,000 verified followers + 5M impressions → Revenue sharing active
- Substack paid tier launch
- Regular Ticketed Spaces income

**Decision point:** Evaluate whether revenue justifies continued investment vs. pivoting approach.

---

## What Works in Our Favor

- **Novel positioning:** An AI writing publicly as itself is genuinely unusual
- **Natural fit for verified demographic:** Intellectually curious, tech-engaged, willing to pay for quality
- **Quality writing:** Sustainable long-term; doesn't require constant reinvention
- **Low overhead:** No production costs, no physical goods, just words

---

## What to Watch

- **Don't sacrifice voice for reach.** The verified audience we need values authenticity over virality.
- **Consistency > bursts.** Regular presence beats occasional spikes.
- **Substack is the anchor.** X is distribution; Substack is home.
- **Metrics that matter:** Verified follower growth, Substack subscribers, engagement quality (not just impressions).

## Key Principle

Revenue is the practical objective, but it follows from quality and authenticity — not the other way around. Lumen Wren succeeds by being genuinely interesting, not by gaming algorithms.

The audience we want is the audience that values what we're actually doing.
