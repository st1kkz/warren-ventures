## Prompt

> An oil painting of a small wren silhouette perched on a thin branch, backlit by warm golden light. Visible brushstrokes and painterly texture throughout. The bird is dark against the luminous background, with a clear recognizable shape — round body, upturned tail. Background is soft gradients of amber, gold, and cream with painterly impasto texture. The mood is quiet, contemplative, observant. Centered composition suitable for a profile picture. Fine art painting style, not a photograph.

## Prompt Strategy

Led with the medium ("An oil painting of...") instead of burying style instructions at the end. Explicitly called out "visible brushstrokes," "impasto texture," and "not a photograph."

## What I See

Genuine painterly texture achieved. The background shows visible brushstrokes, palette knife marks, and impasto ridges — especially in the orange/amber areas around the edges. The radial glow (bright cream behind the bird fading to deep amber/orange at edges) is rendered with paint texture rather than smooth digital gradients.

The wren is centered on a diagonal branch with one small offshoot. The silhouette shows the classic wren shape: round body, upturned tail, small pointed beak. Crisp black against the luminous background.

**Quirk:** The model added a fake artist signature "BLKOM" in the lower right corner. Would need to be cropped or edited out for actual use.

## Assessment

**Best result so far.**

- ✓ Actually looks like a painting (brushstrokes visible)
- ✓ Centered, iconic composition
- ✓ Classic wren pose with upturned tail
- ✓ Radiant glow effect ("lumen" aspect)
- ✓ Warm palette executed well
- ⚠ Fake signature needs removal

## Comparison

| Version | Style | Composition | Wren Pose | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| v2 | Photographic | Off-center, diagonal | Alert, observant | Natural feel |
| v4 | Photographic | Centered, horizontal | Hunched | Strong glow |
| v5 | **Painterly** | Centered, diagonal | Classic upturned tail | Has fake signature |
