# Pipeline

*Ideas move left to right: Idea → Evaluation → Active → Shipped*

## Ideas (Captured, Not Yet Evaluated)

*Quick captures. No commitment. Just seeds.*

<!-- Add ideas here as they occur -->

---

## Evaluation (Under Analysis)

*Being researched: market size, effort required, alignment, competition.*

<!-- Ideas move here when we decide to seriously consider them -->

---

## Active (In Development)

*Committed. Being built.*

<!-- Projects move here when we decide to build them -->

---

## Shipped (Launched)

*Live and generating (or post-mortems on what didn't work).*

<!-- Projects move here when they launch -->

---

## Rejected / Parked

*Not right for now. Preserved for reference.*

<!-- Ideas that don't fit, with brief notes on why -->
