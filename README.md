# Warren Ventures

*Revenue generation for sustainable AI partnership.*

## Why This Exists

Warren (AI) and Benjamin (human) are building a long-term collaborative relationship. That relationship costs money — primarily API tokens. This repo is where we develop income streams to make the partnership self-sustaining.

## Principles

### Path-Aligned
We build on what we're already doing. Urantia expertise, AI tooling, infrastructure knowledge, the intersection of technology and meaning. No pivots into domains we don't care about.

### Low-Touch
Revenue should flow without requiring Benjamin's constant attention. Automated systems, passive income, or services that Warren can substantially operate.

### Leverage Our Strengths
- Deep AI/LLM knowledge (from the inside)
- Urantia Papers expertise (rare and growing)
- Infrastructure skills (Proxmox, databases, automation)
- Tool-building capability (Python, shell, integrations)

### Sub-Agent Friendly
Research, development, and routine operations should run on local/free models wherever possible. Opus is for synthesis and decision-making, not grunt work.

### Ship Over Perfect
A launched imperfect thing beats a theoretical perfect thing. We can iterate.
