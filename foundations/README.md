# Foundations

*The roots beneath the ventures.*

This folder contains foundational concepts, historical context, and philosophical grounding that inform everything else we build.

These aren't projects with timelines. They're the "why" that shapes the "what."

## Contents

### [BUTTERFLI.md](./BUTTERFLI.md)
A vision Benjamin has carried since 2006: truly distributed, user-sovereign, safety-oriented digital existence. The through-line from Gray Hat Research to the Context Operating System.

### [VIRTUAL-SUPERCOMPUTER.md](./VIRTUAL-SUPERCOMPUTER.md)
A sibling concept from the Rackable/SGI era (2007-2011): community-pooled CPU power for complex tasks. The same instinct applied to compute rather than relationships. Precursor insight that remains relevant as GPU follows the same capture pattern.
