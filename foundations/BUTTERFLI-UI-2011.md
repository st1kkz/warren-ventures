## Slide-by-Slide Content

### Slide 1: Title
> **b u t t e r f l i**  
> Freedom to be Truly Social  
> Application concept by Benjamin Bryant.  
> Privacy model by Benjamin Bryant.

### Slide 2: Main Menu
Navigation structure:
- **Top bar:** Search, History, Coach
- **Main functions:** Map, Chat, Listen, Call
- **Bottom bar:** Events, Utilities
- **Core modules:** Activity, Share, My World, Modules, Settings

### Slides 3-5: Activity Use Case
- Displays recent social network activity (email, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) for all contacts within selected context
- Similar to news aggregator (Fluent display referenced as example)
- Additional functionality for replies, comments, forwards
- Context selection via privacy model: The World → All Connections → Personal/Professional/Family
- "Tap to select. Hold to drill in."

### Slides 6-20: Sharing Use Case
**Flow: What → Who → How → Go!**

**What options:**
- Status message
- Picture
- Internet Link
- Video
- (More via modules)

**Who with:**
- Selection via privacy model (concentric circles)
- Tap to select, hold to drill into subcategories
- Professional breaks down to: Coworkers, Customer Contacts, Project Team, Business Partners, Others

**How (channel selection):**
- Options appear based on configured modules AND selected audience scope
- Narrow context (e.g., Business Partners): Email, Text Message, Facebook Wall, Facebook Inbox
- Broad context (e.g., "The World"): Blog, Usenet, public channels
- "Facebook wall posts will have privacy restricted to specific contacts"

**Execution:**
- Shows progress for each channel
- "Sending SMS message to <name>, <name>..."
- "Posting status message to Facebook wall with privacy limited to <name>, <name>..."

### Slides 21-32: My World Use Case
**The Privacy Model:**
- Concentric circles: Family (innermost) → Personal → Professional → All Connections → The World
- Contacts classified within this model
- "Direct association with a less-trusted (outer) circle should negate association with a more trusted circle if selected"
- "Direct association with an inner circle implies indirect association with all surrounding circles"

**Contact Management:**
- Butterfli keeps a "metabase" of contact information with locally cached data
- Does NOT own the substance of contact data — owned by linked resources
- Linked resources available per configured modules (LinkedIn option only if LinkedIn module installed)

**Contact Sources:**
- iPhone Contact
- Facebook Contact
- LinkedIn Contact
- Google Profile
- Etc...

### Slides 33-34: Modules Use Case
**Three module types:**
1. **Communication** — interact with information sources, social networks, communication media
2. **Content sharing** — status, photos, location, videos, files, etc.
3. **Features** — populate bottom nav bar (extensible UI)

**Example installed modules:**
- iPhone (contact list, SMS)
- Email: (address)
- Facebook: (username)
- LinkedIn: (username)
- Add new module...

## Taglines

Two taglines appear throughout:
- **"Freedom to be Truly Social"** — Primary, emphasizes liberation
- **"as social as you want"** — Secondary, emphasizes user control

Both center *agency* over social interaction.

## Open Design Questions (from slides)

1. "I am still unsure how we should link contacts from different modules/sources."
2. "I would like to have an interactive discussion about contact layout, linking and presentation within the model."

These questions remain relevant 15 years later — identity linking and unified contact presentation are still unsolved at the user-sovereignty level.
