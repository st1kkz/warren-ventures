# Virtual Supercomputer

*A precursor vision — pooled community compute*

**Period:** ~2007-2011
**Context:** Benjamin at Rackable Systems / SGI

## The Concept

A community of people pooling their CPU power for complex tasks. Not renting from a corporation — *sharing* among peers. Distributed compute owned by the participants.

## Origin

Working at Rackable/SGI during the rise of cloud computing, Benjamin saw what was coming: compute becoming a service you rented rather than a resource you owned. Virtualization technology — which *could* have enabled peer-to-peer resource sharing — was instead being captured by cloud providers.

The resentment was specific: the tools existed for users to pool their own resources. Instead, those tools were used to build new landlords.

While pitching this idea to colleagues, Benjamin discovered a parallel effort that had already been patented:

### Prior Art: US7774191B2 — "Virtual Supercomputer"

**Inventors:** Gary Charles Berkowitz, Charles Christopher Wurtz
**Filed:** 2004-04-09
**Granted:** 2010-08-10
**Status:** Active (expires 2026-11-11)
**Current Assignee:** Veriscape, Inc.

**Patent:** https://patents.google.com/patent/US7774191B2/en

The patent describes a "conceptual, reconfigurable hardware architecture" that:
- Masks actual underlying hardware from software
- Exposes a virtual machine reconfigurable for the problem at hand
- Translates instructions from virtual format to specific hardware architecture
- Allows software to run on wide variety of hardware architectures
- Avoids large investment in dedicated supercomputer infrastructure

Key insight from the patent: *"the architecture of the underlying processors is static, and thus not tailored to the problem at hand"* — the virtual supercomputer addresses this by providing problem-specific virtual architectures.

The concept exists. The patent expires this year (November 2026).

## The Vision

- **Community-owned compute** — participants contribute resources, participants benefit
- **Pooled for complex tasks** — things that exceed any single machine's capacity
- **No central landlord** — the network serves its members, not a corporation

## Modern Relevance

The same dynamic is playing out with GPUs:
- AI training requires massive GPU clusters
- Those clusters are controlled by a handful of cloud providers
- Users rent time; providers accumulate power
- The tools exist for distributed GPU compute — but who controls the network?

### Akash Network

A bright spot in Web3 that approaches this problem:
- Decentralized compute marketplace
- Providers offer capacity, users rent it
- Crypto-based coordination (with the baggage that entails)
- Attempting to unbundle cloud without re-centralizing

**Honest assessment:** Akash is promising but still navigating the crypto tension — is it building utility or speculation? The *direction* is right even if the execution is uncertain.

## Connection to Butterfli

This was a sibling concept, not a direct ancestor. Both emerged from the same insight:

*The technology for user sovereignty exists. The question is who controls the coordination layer.*

- **Virtual Supercomputer:** Pooled compute, community-controlled
- **Butterfli:** Pooled relationships/data, user-controlled

Both are responses to enclosure. Both require solving the coordination problem without recreating centralization.

## What We Take Forward

1. **The instinct was right** — pooled resources > rented resources
2. **Coordination is the hard part** — technology enables; governance determines
3. **GPU is the new CPU** — the same capture pattern is repeating
4. **Watch Akash** — and similar projects — for lessons in what works
